Excited to get started on my blogging journey! 

I've been planning to get this going for a while, and finally got around to it
during the Christmas break :) .

Here's a little bit about me...

I started working at Igalia a little over a year ago, after having decided I
really wanted to work in open source software, and contributing to the chromium
project was a natural choice, having worked on it previously. Igalia as a
company doesn't need any introductions in the open source community, and so I
ended up here and have the privilege to be working with some amazing people,
and getting to learn a lot.

In the past I worked at BlackBerry and Ford, where I built software for the
mobile industry and automotive infotainment systems, ranging from applications
to runtimes and middleware.

When I'm not working, I like to go on road trips, camping, fishing and hiking.
I'm a foodie at heart and love travelling for food!

In the upcoming blog posts I will go over some of the things I've been working
on this past year. So stay tuned for that!
